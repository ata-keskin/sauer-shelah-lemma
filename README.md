## Abstract

The Sauer-Shelah Lemma is a fundamental result in extremal set theory and combinatorics. It guarantees the existence of a set $T$ of size $k$ that is _shattered_ by a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$, if the cardinality of the family is greater than some bound dependent on $k$. A set $T$ is said to be shattered by a family $\mathcal{F}$ if every subset of $T$ can be obtained as an intersection of $T$ with some set $S \in \mathcal{F}$. 

The Sauer-Shelah Lemma has found use in diverse fields such as computational geometry, approximation algorithms and machine learning. In this entry we formalize the notion of shattering and prove a general version of the Sauer-Shelah Lemma, from which the standard one follows.
